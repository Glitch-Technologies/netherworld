The Netherworld
- Gameplay centers around characters delving into a deep, underworld-esque pit located on the center of an island. 
It's riddled with traps and puzzles, as well as enemies.
- The game starts as a simple text-driven adventure, and expands in it's interactive mediums as the players 
continue to explore. It will implement graphical components from games built between the 1980s and 2000s.
- The player has little control over their characters starting attributes, as they were more or less dropped into this 
lifestyle of adventuring out of necessity.
- Various towns and port cities scatter the island, as it is a key trading point in the larger economy. The deadly pit 
is widely regarded to be a tourist destination, with regular guides offering for-hire excursions.
- Much of the game is centered around it's story. The players will discover the origin of the pit and fate of their
late parents as they continue to progress through the game.
- The players may interact with a variety of NPCs on the island, and will learn about the world away from it, but will not 
be given the option to leave until they complete the main story.
- For the majority of the game, enemies are to be avoided, under the idea that the player-character is too weak to fight them.
